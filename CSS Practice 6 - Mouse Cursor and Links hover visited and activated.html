<!-- Links can be styled with any CSS property (e.g., color, font-family, background, etc.).
In addition, links can be styled differently, depending on what state they are in. The following pseudo selectors are available:
a:link - defines the style for normal unvisited links
a:visited - defines the style for visited links
a:active - a link becomes active once you click on it
a:hover - a link is hovered when the mouse is over it

When setting the style for several link states, there are some order rules:
- a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited
- a:active MUST come after a:hover  -->

<p><a href="http://www.sololearn.com" target="_blank">
   This link is hovered when we mouse over it
</a></p>

<p><a class="noU" href="http://www.sololearn.com" target="_blank">
   This link has no underline.
</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sololearn.com" target="_blank">
  <span style="cursor:help;">
   This link has a question mark when we mouse over it</span></a></p>
   <!-- There are many mouse types available to replace the "cursor:help"

 Another way in the the CSS directly:

 p {
  cursor: help;
 }
-->

<style>
a:hover {
   color: red;
}
a.noU:link {
   text-decoration: none;
}
</style>

<!-- The following properties are used to control the look and feel of links:
border:none - removes border from images with links
outline:none - removes the dotted border on clicked lines in IE -->
