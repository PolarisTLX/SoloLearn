<!--
display: block
It "blocks out" a horizontal slice of the page.  A block element is an element that takes up the fullest width available, with line breaks before and after. -->

<style>
span {
   display: block;
}
</style>

<!--
display: inline
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary, and does not force line breaks. -->

<style>
p {
   display: inline;
}
</style>



<!--
display:none     /   visibility:hidden (below)
Hides an element, so it does not take up any space. The element will be hidden, and the page will be displayed as if the element is not there. -->

<h1>This text will not display, as we set the value to none.</h1>
<p>Headline of this paragraph is not displayed, as we set the value to none.</p>

<style>
h1 {
   display: none;
}
</style>


<!--
visibility:hidden
The visibility property specifies whether an element is visible or hidden. The most common values are visible and hidden.

Hiding an element can be done by setting the display property to "none" or the visibility property to "hidden". However, notice that these two methods produce different results:
visibility:hidden hides an element, but it will still take up the same space as before. The element will be hidden, but it will still affect the layout: -->


<!--
position: fixed
An element with a fixed position is positioned relative to the browser window, and will not move even if the window is scrolled.
The position can be specified using one or more of the properties top, right, bottom, and left.
Fixed positioned elements are removed from the normal flow. The document and other elements behave like the fixed positioned element does not exist.
Fixed positioned elements can overlap other elements. -->

<style>
p.position_fixed {
   position: fixed;
   top: 30px;
   right: 5px;
   color: red;
}
</style>

<!--
position: relative;
A relative positioned element is positioned relative to its normal position.
The content of relatively positioned elements can be moved and overlap other elements,
but the reserved space for the element is still preserved in the normal flow.
This value cannot be used for table cells, columns, column groups, rows, row groups, or captions.

<!--
float: right; or float: left;
Elements are floated horizontally, meaning that an element can only be floated left or right, not up or down.
Use the property "width: ---px;"  along with float to make the elements float side by side? -->

<p><img src="https://www.sololearn.com/images/fb-story-icon.jpg" />
This paragraph has an image that is floated to the <strong>right.</strong>
It is highly recommended to add a margin to images so that the text does
not get too close to the image. If you want your text to be easily read, you
should always add a few pixels between words and borders, images,
and other content.

<style>
img {
   float: right;

Use the values right, left, and both to specify the sides of an element where other floating elements are not allowed to be.

<!--
overflow: scroll;
The CSS overflow property specifies the behavior that occurs when an element's content overflows the element's box.
There are four values for the overflow property: visible (the default value), scroll, hidden, and auto.
The value scroll results in clipped overflow, but a scrollbar is added, so the rest of the content may be seen.
It produces horizontal and vertical scrollbars

overflow: auto; - If overflow is clipped, a scroll-bar should be added to make it possible to see the rest of the content.

overflow: hidden; - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible.-->

</br></br>
</br></br>
<div class="overflow">
This text is inside the div element, which has a blue
background color and is floated to the left. We set a specific
height and width for the div element, and as you can see,
the content cannot fit.
</div>
</br>
<div class="overflow">
This div has the same properties and set height and width,
but less words, so it fits and has no scroll (but scroll bar still present?). Fix: "auto"
</div>

<style>
div.overflow {
   width: 150px;
   height: 150px;
   background-color: LightBlue;
   /*overflow: scroll;  this makes scroll bars appear no matter what */
   overflow: auto;  /*this makes scroll bars appear only if needed*/
}
</style>


<!--
The z-index Property:
When elements are positioned outside the normal flow, they can overlap other elements.
The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be placed in front of, or behind, the others).

In an example where: The red box overlaps the blue box, because it was placed later in the HTML markup.
The z-index property can change this order.

Higher z-index is closer to the viewer.
Assigning a higher z-index value to the blue div and a lower z-index value to the red div will put the blue on top

The CSS:
.blue {
   z-index: 3;
   position: relative;
}
.red {
   z-index: 2;
   position: relative;
}


The z-index works ONLY on positioned elements (position:absolute, position:relative, or position:fixed). -->
