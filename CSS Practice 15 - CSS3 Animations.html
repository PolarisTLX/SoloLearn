<!-- CSS3 Animations

The @keyframes Rule

When you specify CSS styles inside the @keyframes rule,
the animation will gradually change from the current style to the new style at certain times.

The following example will change the background color of an element three times:
when the animation is 50% complete, 70% complete, and when the animation is 100% complete. -->


<!--
@keyframes examplename {
   0%  {background-color: red;}
   50%  {background-color: yellow;}
   70%  {background-color: blue;}
   100% {background-color: green;}
} -->


<!--
As an alternative to using percentages, you can use from and to keywords, where:
"from" is a starting offset of 0%
"to" is an ending offset of 100%.

The two examples below are equivalent, and produce the same result: -->

<!--
@keyframes colorchange {
   0% {background-color: red;}
   100% {background-color: green;}
} -->


<!-- same as: -->

<!--
@keyframes colorchange {
   from {background-color: red;}
   to {background-color: green;}
} -->



<!-- Example: -->

<div class="colorchange">This changes 3 colors after 2s delay and loops 5 times</div>
<!-- If the animation-duration property is not specified, the animation will have no effect, because the default value is 0.
If the animation name does not match any keyframe rule, the animation will not execute.

div.whatever {
  animation-name: colorchange;
  =
@keyframes colorchange {

div.whatever {
  animation-name: makeupname;
  =
@keyframes makeupname {
   -->

<style>
div.colorchange {
   width: 100px;
   height: 100px;
   background-color: red;
   animation-name: colorchange;
   animation-duration: 2s;
   animation-delay: 2s;
   animation-iteration-count: 5;
}


@keyframes colorchange {
   0% {background-color: red;}
   50% {background-color: green;}
   100% {background-color: blue;}
}
</style>


<!-- The animation-timing-function specifies the speed curve of an animation. It can have the following values:
ease - specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
linear - specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end
ease-in - specifies an animation with a slow start
ease-out - specifies an animation with a slow end
ease-in-out - specifies an animation with a slow start and end
cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function

The CSS syntax looks like this:
     {
animation-timing-function: linear;
}


animation-delay - defines the delay before an animation starts. The CSS syntax looks like this:
animation-delay: 2s;


The animation-delay and animation-duration values can be defined in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms). -->


<!-- The animation-iteration-count property determines the number of times an animation repeats.
For example, you can set the animation to run 5 times:

    {
animation-iteration-count: 5;
}


To make the animation repeat forever, just use the infinite value:

     {
animation-iteration-count: infinite;
} -->


<!--
The animation-direction indicates how the keyframe should be applied.
The values can be set as:

normal - the default value, which means it plays forward from 0 % to 100%.
reverse - plays the keyframe in an opposite direction from 100 % to 0%
alternate - the animation first runs forward, then backward, then forward.
alternate reverse - the animation first runs backward, then forward, then backward.

    {
animation-direction: alternate;
}

If you use 0 or a negative number for the animation-iteration-count, the animation will never start. -->


<!--
SORTHAND EXAMPLE:

LONGHAND:
div {
   animation-name: colorchange;
   animation-duration: 3s;
   animation-timing-function: ease-in;
   animation-delay: 1s;
   animation-iteration-count: infinite;
   animation-direction: reverse;
}


SHORTHAND for the same result as the above code:
div {
   animation: colorchange 3s ease-in 1s infinite reverse;
}

This appears to be in this particular order:
animation: -name  -duration  -timing-function  -delay  -iteration-count  -direction

The order in which each property is declared in the shorthand declaration
is important and cannot be altered, or the animation will not work properly.
