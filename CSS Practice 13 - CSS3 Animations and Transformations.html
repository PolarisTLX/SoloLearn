<!-- CSS3 Transitions

CSS3 transitions allow us to change from one property value to another over a given duration.
Transition effects can be applied to a wide variety of CSS properties, including:

background-color, width, height, opacity, and many more.

transition-property - specifies the property to be transitioned
transition-duration - specifies the duration over which transitions should occur
transition-timing-function - specifies how the pace of the transition changes over its duration
transition-delay - specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect

Example:  transition property = transform, duration = 5 seconds, timing function = "ease-in" that specifies a transition effect with a slow start.

     {
transition: transform 5s ease-in;
} -->


<!--
div:hover   (hover mouse over object)
div:active  (hold mouse down on object to progress transition)
div:focus   (modifies a form field once a field is selected/clicked on)

-->

<div class="widen">Words are here to test this out.</div>

<div class="extend">Words are ALSO here to test this out.</div>

</br></br></br></br></br>
</br></br></br></br></br>
<div>
  <label>Type your name</label>
  <input type="text"></input>

<style>

div.widen {
   float: left;
   width: 50px;
   height: 50px;
   background: #32CD32;
   transition: width 3s;
}
div.widen:hover {
   width: 250px;
}

div.extend {
   float: left;
   width: 50px;
   height: 50px;
   background: #3246cd;
   transition: height 3s;
}
div.extend:active {
   height: 250px;
}
input {
  width: 150px;
  transition: width 3s;
}
input:focus{
  width: 300px;
}

</style>

transition-timing-function

The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.
It can have the following values:
ease - the animation starts slowly, then accelerates quickly.
ease-in - starts slowly, then accelerates, and stops abruptly.
ease-out - starts quickly, but decelerates to a stop.
ease-in-out - similar to ease, but with more subtle acceleration and deceleration.
linear - constant speed throughout the animation; often best for color or opacity changes.

Finally, we have cubic-bezier(), which allows you to define your own values in the cubic-bezier function. Possible values are numeric values from 0 to 1.
transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0,0,1,1);

If no timing function is specified, the default value is ease. -->
